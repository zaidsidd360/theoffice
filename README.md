<h1>The office: Michael's kingdom</h1>

<p>This is a project that's very near and dear to my heart. Firstly, because <strong>The Office</strong> is my most beloved sitcom ever, and secondly, because this was my first solo <strong>React js</strong> project. It helped me learn a lot about the core functionality of react. I learned why <strong>jsx</strong> is so over powered. It was a very fun project overall.</p>
