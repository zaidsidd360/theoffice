# The office: Michael's kingdom
I couldn't find an official webpage for my favourite sitcom so I created one. This was my first ever Reactjs project. It helped me learn a lot about the core functionality of react. I learned why jsx is so over powered. It was a very fun project overall.

Areas of focus: hooks, conditional rendering, routing, useState, useEffect, jsx.
